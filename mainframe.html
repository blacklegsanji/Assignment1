   Death Note is a Japanese manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata. The story follows Light    Yagami, a high school student who discovers a supernatural notebook that grants its user the ability to kill anyone whose name and face they know. The series    centers around Light's subsequent attempts to create and rule a world "cleansed of evil" as "God" using the notebook, and the efforts of a detective known as L to    stop him.
   <ul>
   <li>The human whose name is written in this note shall die.</li><br>
   <li>This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not        be affected.</li><br>
   <li>If the cause of death is written within the next 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.</li><br>
   <li>If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack.</li><br>
   <li>After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.</li><br>
